# Admin Publish/Unpublish Fix Summary

## Issue
The admin panel's publish/unpublish functionality was not working due to Next.js 15 compatibility issues with dynamic route parameters.

## Root Cause
In Next.js 15, dynamic route parameters (`params`) must be awaited in API routes. The code was accessing `params` directly without awaiting, causing the routes to fail.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/app/api/admin/posts/[slug]/status/route.js`
**Issue:** Status toggle route not handling params correctly
**Fix:** Added `const resolvedParams = await params;` before accessing slug

### 2. `/app/api/admin/posts/[slug]/route.js`
**Issue:** GET, PUT, and DELETE methods not handling params correctly
**Fix:** Added `const resolvedParams = await params;` in all three methods

### 3. `/app/api/posts/[slug]/route.js`
**Issue:** GET method not handling params correctly
**Fix:** Added `const resolvedParams = await params;` before accessing slug

### 4. `/app/api/contact-submissions/[id]/route.js`
**Issue:** DELETE method not handling params correctly
**Fix:** Added `const resolvedParams = await params;` before accessing id

## Changes Made

### Before:
```javascript
export async function PUT(request, { params }) {
  try {
    const { slug } = params;  // ❌ Direct access - fails in Next.js 15
    // ...
  }
}
```

### After:
```javascript
export async function PUT(request, { params }) {
  try {
    // Await params for Next.js 15+ compatibility
    const resolvedParams = await params;  // ✅ Properly awaited
    const { slug } = resolvedParams;
    // ...
  }
}
```
